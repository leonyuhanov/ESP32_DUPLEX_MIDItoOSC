# KorgMINILOG_TouchOSC
A bidirectional Hardware MIDI system for displaying/controlling MIDI Controls via Touch OSC 

This project uses an ESP32 connected to the MIDI IN and OUT ports on a Kork Monologue (however this is designed to be genral purpose for any MIDI device). The ESP32 has as elf hosted web based UI that alows you to dynamicly map any MIDI control to any OSC control on the fly. 

This is a work in progress so it doesnt work 100% yet
